# Introduction
In this project I was able to analyze netflix viewing data from Jan - June 2023.This project analyzes what genres and shows were popular this year (2023) and compares the correlation between the hours of viewing vs theamount of ratinfs for each show. I was able to use multiple technologies to answer questions risen from this dataset. 

# Data Sources
I obtained this data from  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vassyesboy/netflix-engagement-jan-jun-23. Kaggle website that contains datasets for analyzing and this data set was called Netflix engagement jan-june-23.

# Technologies Used
The tech stack I used for this project was Excel, SQL and the BI tool Tableau.

# Project Structure
The project structure of this project is simple. The CSV file I used is in the directory as well as my dumped SQL file containing all queries that analyzed the dataset. Lastly my Tableau dashboard URL is attached here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bladimir.nunez/viz/NetflixDashboard_17035717795880/Dashboard1

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
I imported the CSV file into excel to begin cleaning the dataset. I started with removing all duplicate values to then standarizing my dataset so all columns are upper case if they are text and the date columns would all be the same format. I dropped all missing values in my dataset so it would not negatively alter my data as I was creating my visualizations. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis



# Challenges Faced
This was my first introduction into Tableau and it was the only challenge I had. I learned how to navigate the application and what to filter and modify such as columns when I add them to a row and column. After this I got my feet wet with the software and now comfortable to move onto other projects using Tableau.

# Conclusion
This project was my first time using a BI tool to analyze data and find trends and statistics about this specific dataset. This project was signifcant due to it being the first full data analysis project I completed where I got to access and import data, clean the data for analysis, find metrics about the data and lastly use those metrics to answer questions through visualizations.
