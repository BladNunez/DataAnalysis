# Introduction
In this project I was able to analyze netflix viewing data from Jan - June 2023.This project analyzes what genres and shows were popular this year (2023) and compares the correlation between the hours of viewing vs the amount of ratinfs for each show.

# Data Sources
I obtained this data from  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vassyesboy/netflix-engagement-jan-jun-23. Kaggle website that contains datasets for analyzing and this data set was called Netflix engagement jan-june-23.

# Technologies Used
The tech stack I used for this project was Excel, SQL and the BI tool Tableau.

# Project Structure
The project structure of this project is simple. The CSV file I used is in the directory as well as my dumped SQL file containing all queries that analyzed the dataset. Lastly my Tableau dashboard URL is attached.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
I imported the CSV file into excel to begin cleaning the dataset. I started with removing all duplicate values to then standarizing my dataset so all columns are upper case if they are text and the date columns would all be the same format.
