Patient Health Profile Analysis

1. Data Exploration:
   * Load the dataset and understand its structure.
   * Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
   * Obtain summary statistics to get a sense of the data.

2. Data Cleaning:
   * address any inconsistencies or outliers in the data
   * Standardize or normalize numerical features if needed.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   * Visualize the distribution of age, BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
   * Explore relationships between variables using scatter plots or correlation matrices.

4. Health Profile Insights:
   * Create categories for BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels (e.g., normal, high, low).
   * Analyze the distribution of patients across these categories.
   * Identify any patterns or trends related to age, gender, or other demographic factors.

5. Demographic Analysis:
   * Explore the age distribution of patients.
   * Compare health profiles between different age groups or genders.

6. Visualization:
   * Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to represent key insights.
   * Use Matplotlib or Seaborn for plotting.


7. Basic Statistical Analysis:
   * Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, and mode for relevant variables.

8. Conclusion:
   * Summarize your findings and insights from the analysis.
   * Highlight any interesting observations or correlations.

9. Documentation:
   * Document your analysis in a Jupyter notebook, including code comments for clarity.
   * Provide explanations for each step and any assumptions made.
