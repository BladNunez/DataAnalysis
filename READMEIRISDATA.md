# About Project
- This project was to help us learn python and be able to use pandas and matplotlib to 
- be able to plot information from the Iris dataset which was a study about three diffrent 
- plant species and the information consisted of there length and width of sepal and petal.

# Run file
- Locally I used the command python3 "filename(design0.py)" in terminal to run my program and 
- this will display two figures containing my charts.

# Project Process
- I began with the first chart of comparing the sepal length and width of the three species
- this chart was a scatter plot. I used slicing and sliced each section of the dataset and 
- grouped the same species length/width together and after doing that I was able to plot 
- each species with a specific marker and color for each. The same was done for the subplot
- to compare the species petal length/width.
