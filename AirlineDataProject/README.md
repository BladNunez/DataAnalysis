# AirlineData
This small project is an introduction into data analysis. I was able to download Airline data from all the countrys in the world and this held information on how many passengers each country flew in a specific year. I was able to clean the data from missing values, duplicates and outliers. I changed one column from objects values into integers so I was able to find the mean,median and mode of passengers carried. I got to practice plotting information and I plotted the top 5 countrys and there passengers flown information for the year 2021.
