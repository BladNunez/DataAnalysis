# La Liga Player Analysis

## Project Overview
This project consists of La Liga player statistics for the 2022-2023 season. With this dataset I am able to gain insights on player performance during the 2022-2023 La Liga season such as who scored the most goals and obtained the most assists. In this project I was able to compare and analyze player performance across the
league.

## Data Sources
My dataset comes from the Kaggle website here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rayhan32/la-liga-player-status-season-2022-2023 . The dataset was downloaded from here and is contained in the 'laliga.csv' file. This file contains all information about the players such as name, affiliated team, goals, assists, etc. 

## Tools
SQL - Data Analysis

Tableau - Dashboard Reports

## Conclusion/Insights

From my findings about this dataset I find that even if a player has the highest attempts on the net they wont score the most goals. I also find that the average age in La Liga is relativley young at the age of 27. This would mean that most players here will be playing for another decade. During the 2022-2023 season there were 4 teams that were penalized the most and that was  Espanyol, Real Valladolid ,Villarreal and Elche. I also found that there were many players who did not play this season but due to the average age of players in the league being young I predict they will see playing time in the following seasons.
