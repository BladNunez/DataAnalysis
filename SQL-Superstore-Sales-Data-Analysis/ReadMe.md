In this SQL project I analyzed data on a superstore sales dataset. I used basicto intermediate SQL queries to obtain information such as amount of orders per region to differentiating diffrent order segments in particular states. 

I obtained the sales dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting

MySQL workbench was used for this project starting with the importation of my CSV file containing my dataset into MySQL workbench.
